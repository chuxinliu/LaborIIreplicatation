Readme for Crosswalks between PUMAs and CZs

	Many researchers are using Census files from IPUMS (Ruggles et al., 2017) to study U.S. local markets defined at the Commuting Zone (CZ) level.  In those files, individual respondents' exact locations are suppressed to protect their anonymity. Instead, locations are identified by the group of counties in which respondents reside. In the 1980 sample these are called county-groups.  Starting with the 1990 samples they are called PUMAs.  County-groups/PUMAs may be either wholly contained within a CZ or overlap CZ boundaries.  This page includes crosswalks between PUMAs and CZs.  In cases where the county-group/PUMA crosses CZ boundaries, the crosswalks assign respondents to CZs in proportion to the share of the county-group/PUMA population that falls within each CZ.  I used county-level population counts from the Census Bureau to generate the shares.

	There are four crosswalks (one each for the 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 versions of IPUMS county groups).  The readme.txt file has instructions at the bottom for merging with an IPUMS data set.  That example allocates PUMA-specific counts of respondents to CZs.  Calculating CZ means would involve a tweak to the merging code.

	Here are links to the crosswalks and the IPUMS samples that they match:

	puma_cz_cross_1980.dta: 1980 Census 5 percent sample
	puma_cz_cross_1990.dta: 1990 Census 5 percent sample
	puma_cz_cross_2000.dta: 2000 Census 5 percent sample and the ACS/PRCS samples from 2005 to 2011
	puma_cz_cross_2010.dta: 2010 Census and 2012-onward ACS/PRCS

The nearby files are crosswalks between county groups or public-use micro data areas (PUMAs) and
commuting zones (CZs).  IPUMS Census data include county group or PUMA of respondents, and we want to
perform calculations at the CZ level.  This readme file describes the crosswalks without a lot of
detail.  For more detail and access to the programs that generate the crosswalks, contact me at

I got Census population counts by county in the US and county group (or PUMA) definitions from IPUMS
(www.ipums.org).

I got information about the 1990 definition of Commuting Zones based on crosswalks I downloaded from
the US Department of Agriculture web page.

The main complication in crosswalking here arises because sometimes a single PUMA overlaps multiple CZs.
The variables in the crosswalk files identify population shares that overlap.  E.g., a county group whose
population is 30 percent in CZ A and 70 percent in CZ B will be allocated 30 percent to CZ A and 70 to CZ B,
even though we wonâ€™t know which residents in that county group are in which CZ.

The variables in the crosswalk files are:
	statefip: State FIPS code
	puma: county groups in IPUMS for 1980 through 2010 are only unique within states (e.g., there might
		be a PUMA=1 for Virginia and another PUMA=1 for North Carolina.).
	cz90: the CZ90 code for a CZ90 that shares population with the puma.  The CZ90
		codes are explained in the enclosed document Tolbert_Sizer_CZs.pdf.
	popY: the population in Census year Y in the intersection between (statefip puma) and cz90
	pumapopY: the population in (statefip puma) in Census year Y (parts of the PUMA that share
		population with cz90 plus the rest of the PUMA).
	czpopY: the population in cz90 in Census year Y (parts of the CZ90 that share
		population with (statefip puma) plus the rest of the CZ90).
	county_prop_incz=popY/czpopY
	county_prop_inpuma=popY/pumapopY

In many cases, a PUMA is completely enclosed within a CZ, so county_prop_inpuma=1.  Other times, a PUMA
shares population with multiple CZs.  The way I generate CZ-specific population measures is to assign
to a CZ the characteristics of its member PUMAs, in proportion to their population shares in the CZ.


========================================
Code for counting populations by CZ using data on populations by IPUMS Census county group or PUMA

Below is code from a program that reads a data set (temp1990all.dta) where each observation is a respondent to
the 1990 Census.  It keeps only those with high school or less education.  It then uses a collapse command
(using population weights) to estimate the population of people with this educational attainment in each PUMA.
It merges in a crosswalk between PUMAs and commuting zones (CZs).  This merge identifies all CZs that overlap
each PUMA.  The file then assigns each PUMA population to overlapping CZs in proportion to the population overlap
identified in the crosswalk file.  It ends with a data set where each observation is a CZ and the main variable
is the estimate of the high school or less population in the CZ.


use temp1990all, clear
keep if lths==1|hs==1
gen puma_N_hsless=1
collapse (sum) puma_N_hsless [pw=perwt], by(statefip puma)
merge 1:m statefip puma using puma_cz_cross_1990
bysort cz90: egen cz_N_hsless=sum(county_prop_inpuma*puma_N_hsless)
by cz90: keep if _n==_N
egen natl_N_hsless=sum(cz_N_hsless)
keep cz90 cz_N_hsless natl_N_hsless
save census1990cz_N_hsless, replace
